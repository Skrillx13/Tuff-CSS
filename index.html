    <h1>Tuff CSS</h1>
    <p>
        This is a fork of the original <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS</a>
        project. It adds extra functionality such as support for Syntax Highlighting through PrismJS, using the MathJax
        library to render Mathematics, adding extra functionaity and fixing styles that are broken (The padding towards
        the right is broken, and will not work for the original project).
    </p>
    <p><strong>NOTE!!!!</strong> Any "" you see are placeholders. They are meant to be code, but I'm working on shifting the
        Syntax Highlighter. This also serves as a reminder for me, because I'm forgetfull.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        Add <code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://latex.vercel.app/style.css"&gt;</code> to
        the "" of your website, or install the package with <code class="language-shell">npm install tuff-css</code>.
        From here, you can start writing your desired HTML, or load in any additional components, as referenced in the
        section below.
    </p>
    <p>$$C(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_{i}(n) 10^{-i}$$</p>
    <h3>Additionals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can load all of our extra components by including "" at the end of the closing "" tag, as well as
            including "" in the head of your website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Syntax Highlighting:</strong> To add Syntax Highlighting to your website, add "" to the head of
            your website. This is the CSS for our Prism theme. You will also need to add "" before the closing "" tag.
            That is the Prism JavaScript, which is important.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Anchor Headings:</strong> To load Anchor Headings, include "" before the closing "" tag. This comes
            with our own configuration for AnchorJS, which is a # for the icon, and custom scrolling behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MathJax Support:</strong> To include MathJax support, simply include "" before the closing "" tag.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>
        Just like Tufte CSS, Tuff CSS has some practices you should keep in mind when using.
